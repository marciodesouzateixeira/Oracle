# Oracle Forms and Reports

Here I will share with you a personal project that I created to demonstrate my skills in Oracle Forms and Reports.
The project consists of a reduced version of a sales system that I will call SalesPower here.
At SalesPower it is possible:
- log in
- register users
- register customers
- register products
- make a sale
- print a receipt for a sale
- print a customer report

# Below is an overview of Forms

## Login
The first screen we have in the system is the login screen, where the user and password are validated, and if the user is not found or the password is invalid, an error message will be returned and if successful, the user will have access to system main menu screen.
