# Oracle Forms and Reports

Here I will share with you a personal project that I created to demonstrate my skills in Oracle Forms and Reports.
The project consists of a reduced version of a sales system that I will call SalesPower here.
At SalesPower it is possible:
- log in
- register users
- register customers
- register products
- make a sale
- print a receipt for a sale
- print a customer report

# Below is an overview of Forms
