# Oracle PL/SQL

This is a presentation portfolio for a reduced example of a DB that controls the registration of Customers, Products and Sales.

All the tables have a primary key, a foreign key, indexes on the main fields and sequences to avoid problems with the primary key.

There are also triggers to automatically record the date and time for creating and updating each record.

There is a logging process for each record creation and change, so triggers and a specific table for logs were used.
